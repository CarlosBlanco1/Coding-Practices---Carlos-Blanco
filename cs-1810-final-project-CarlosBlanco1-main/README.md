What is the main idea of the project?

For my final CS 1810 project, I plan to create a webpage that provides food recipes to users. Users will be able to specify their dietary requirements such as calorie, protein, fat, vitamin, and mineral intake. The webpage will then search through a JSON file containing various recipes and display those that meet the user's criteria. Once the user selects a recipe, they will be redirected to a more detailed page containing ingredient lists, preparation instructions, and other relevant information.

Why is this something you are genuinely interested in? (Please make sure that you pick a project that really interests you!)

I chose this topic as a consequence of my interest in the fitness world. One of the things you come to understand is how important nutrition is when it comes to achieveing your body goals. In that sense, I spent a lot of time online looking for recipes that would allow me to reach my goals. However, I found it tedious and complicated to find all of the information I was looking for and that led to me to want to create this page.

What is the ambitious version (if you had all summer to work on the project)?

I think that if I had more time to code this I would focus on improving 2 aspects. Firstly, expanding the dish database in order to provide a greater variety of options to the user. Additionally, adding a function that outputs the dish depending on available ingredients rather than nutritional values. Secondly, I would focus on providing a rich interface that was very attractive to the user and looked aesthetically pleasing.

What is the target version (20 hours of dedicated, undivided work, including work done already)?

For a version requiring 20 hours of work, I plan to create a simple yet responsive interface that offers around 10-15 recipes. These recipes will include ingredient lists, preparation instructions, nutritional information, and some images. If time permits, I may also include a feedback section for users to share their thoughts and recommendations on the recipes.

What is the smallest useful version?

I don't really understand what the question refers to, but I think it refers to the smallest device I plan to have the page running on, and that would be a phone. To be specific, the IPhone SE, which has dimensions 375x667.
